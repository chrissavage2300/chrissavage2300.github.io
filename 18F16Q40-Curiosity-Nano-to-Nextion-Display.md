# Curosity Nano to Nextion display
![Nextion](https://github.com/chrissavage2300/chrissavage2300.github.io/blob/main/photos/Nextion_Display.jpg?raw=true)

This page deals with the code on both the microcontroller side and HMI (nextion) side of things to get these two talking without a library. 
I had to figure some of this out on my own, so I want to share some of the knowledge I found along the way. In the end, you can say I started to make a library, but this is much more readable than the usual stuff you can find.

Parts used:

 <ul>
  <li>PIC18F16Q40 CURIOSITY NANO </li>
  <li>Nextion NX3224T024</li>
  <li>USB to UART converter (anyone works)</li> 
</ul> 

Software:

 <ul>
  <li>Nextion Editor V1.63.3</li>
  <li>MPLAB X V6.00</li>
  <li>XC8 V2.20 or better</li>
  <li>MPLAB Code Configurator V5</li> 
  

</ul>
