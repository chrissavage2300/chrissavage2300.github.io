Hello and welcome to my github page. Here you will find a link to some info for some of the projects Ive done.

There isnt much going on right now, but Im trying my best to document things.

### 18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display Project
[18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display](./18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display.md)
This project deals with the PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity and Nextion display. This page will serve to document my findings so I can help others.

### Coffee Roaster Project
