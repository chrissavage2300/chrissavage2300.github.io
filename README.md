Hello and welcome to my github page. Here you will find a link to some info for some of the projects Ive done.

There isnt much going on right now, but Im trying my best to document things.

### 18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display Project
[18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display](./18F16Q40-Curiosity-Nano-to-Nextion-Display.md)
This project deals with the PIC18F16Q40 Curiosity and Nextion display. This page will serve to document my findings so I can help others.

### Coffee Roaster Project
[(Link)](https://github.com/chrissavage2300/Air-Fryer-Coffee-Roaster)
This project involves making a custom PID controller with a PIC micro, and using a "broken" air fryer to roast coffee. Currently on version 1.2

### Version 2.0 Coffee Roaster Project

This project is a custom job that uses a welded frame. Same Idea but I also chose to use a dsPIC instead.

[Version 2.0](https://github.com/chrissavage2300/Coffee-Roaster-V2)

### Sk9822 LED LAMP:
This is a RGB lamp I created from an older version of something I first started. It has a low power mode, uses a PIC16F and its powered from a lithium battery. Run time is up to 4 days always on. Low Power mode is something like 300 days.
This repo also has another version that is untested: WS2812. I wanted to use the LEDs with both RGB and Warm White but it doesnt use a standard protocol. I have gotten a WS2812 LED to work with a PIC Micro. The hardware is untested but should work.
